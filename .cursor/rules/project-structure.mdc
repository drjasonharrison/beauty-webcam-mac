# BeautyWebcam Project Structure

## Project Overview
BeautyWebcam is a macOS application that provides real-time webcam enhancement through a virtual camera system. The project is built using Objective-C with native macOS frameworks.

## Key Project Files
- [PRD.md](mdc:PRD.md) - Product Requirements Document
- [todo.md](mdc:todo.md) - Development roadmap and task breakdown

## Core Architecture Components

```

## Framework Usage
- **CoreMediaIO**: Virtual camera device creation
- **AVFoundation**: Video capture session management
- **Metal**: GPU-accelerated image processing
- **Core Image**: Real-time filter processing
- **AppKit**: Menu bar and UI components
- **IOKit**: Low-level hardware communication

## Performance Requirements
- CPU Usage: <15% on M1 MacBook Air
- Memory Usage: <150MB total footprint
- Latency: <50ms capture to output
- Frame Rate: 30fps minimum, 60fps target

## Code Organization Principles
1. Separate concerns: capture, processing, output
2. Use composition over inheritance
3. Implement proper error handling throughout
4. Follow Apple's memory management best practices
5. Use modern Objective-C features (nullable annotations, generics)
